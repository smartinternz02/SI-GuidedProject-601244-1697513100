SpaceX Falcon 9 is a reusable rocket developed by SpaceX for carrying payloads into space. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket is designed to return to Earth after launch, and land vertically on a designated landing pad or drone ship. This technology enables SpaceX to reduce the cost of space launches by reusing the rocket instead of discarding it after a single use. The success of Falcon 9 first stage landing launches depends on various factors such as the flight number, payload mass, orbit, launch site, and others. By building a machine learning model that can predict the success of these launches based on these factors, we can provide valuable insights for space agencies, researchers, and other stakeholders. For example, space agencies can use this tool to evaluate the risks associated with launching payloads into space using Falcon 9 rockets. Researchers can use this tool to study the factors that contribute to the success of space launches and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, stakeholders such as investors and commercial space companies can use this tool to make informed decisions about the feasibility and profitability of space launches. Overall, the project provides a practical application of machine learning techniques in the space industry and has the potential to benefit various stakeholders by providing valuable insights into the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing launches.
